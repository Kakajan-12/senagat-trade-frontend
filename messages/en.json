    "title": "Senagat Trade – Your Trusted Partner in Raw Material Supply",
    "text": "Established in 2017, Senagat Trade initially focused on supplying specialized packaging materials before expanding its portfolio to include diverse chemicals by 2019. A pivotal step in 2021 was the launch of stock sales from our Ashgabat warehouse, making us a key supplier of essential chemicals like Caustic Soda Flakes for the manufacturing sector. Today, we offer a comprehensive raw materials portfolio, emphasizing chemicals for household goods, complemented by tailored packaging solutions. Our future vision involves leveraging this expertise to venture into manufacturing with a new partner, aiming to launch our own products and solidify our position as a trusted, full-spectrum partner in the domestic and international supply chain.",
